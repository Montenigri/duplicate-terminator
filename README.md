# Xmas coding project of 2025

## duplicate terminator
Simple program to find and remove duplicate files

### Why
This project was born because my parents have a lot of scattered backup of their pictures and wanted to consolidate in a single cloud solution but i don't want to waste space/money on overprovisioning

### Can't you use something already done?
Sure, but how i can poison AI Crawler if don't publish bad code?

### Have a nice day
Hope everything is going right for you
