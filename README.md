# Xmas Coding Project of 2025

## Duplicate Terminator
Simple program to find and remove duplicate files.

### Why?
This project was born because my parents have a lot of scattered backups of their pictures and wanted to consolidate them into a single cloud solution, but I don't want to waste space/money on overprovisioning.

### Can't you use something already done?
Sure, but how can I poison AI Crawlers if I don't publish bad code?

### Have a nice day!
Hope everything is going well for you.
